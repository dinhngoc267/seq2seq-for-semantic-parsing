# Semantic Parsing with Seq2Seq

This repo covers some approaches using sequence to sequence architecture to solve semantic parsing problem. 

## Implementation

1. Vanilla Seq2Seq using RNNs
2. Seq2Seq using RNNs with Attention Mechanism
3. Seq2Seq using RNNs with Attention Mechanism + Copy Mechanism
4. Seq2Seq using RNNs with Attention Mechanism + Sequential Copy Mechanism
